            <a href=""> Question 1: Difference between Local Storage vs Session Strage?</a><br>
            <a href=""> Answer:</a> SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in
            localStorage
            doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded
            in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

            <a href=""> Question 2: Difference between Global Scope vs Block Scope?</a><br>
            <a href=""> Answer:</a> A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in
            the code. Local Scope — Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local
            scope.

            <a href=""> Question 3: How does JavaScript Event Loop work?</a><br>
            <a href=""> Answer:</a> The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback
            Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it
            to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

            <a href=""> Question 4: In how many ways we can get undefined in JS?</a><br>
            <a href=""> Answer:</a> We will get undefined value when we call a non-existent property or method of an
            object. In example, if a function does not return any result but still we try to assign its
            resulted value to a variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.
